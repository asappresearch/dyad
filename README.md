# dyad

This is the repository for the DYAD long paper at the NEURIPS'23 WANT workshop, by Sarin and Varun [advised by Yi Yang and Gabe Maggiotti]

Here we will be sharing our layer's pytorch code and an example of how to edit a huggingface transformers existing model to use our layer instead of the typical linear layer nn.Linear(), which we refer to in our work as DENSE.
